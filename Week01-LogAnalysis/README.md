# Week 1 â€“ Log Analysis 101 with Windows Event Viewer
# Completed - June 20, 2025

## Objective
Analyze Windows event logs to detect signs of unauthorized access, suspicious file changes, or brute-force login attempts.

---

## Tools Used
- Windows 10 Event Viewer
- Built-in Windows audit logging

---

## Steps Performed

1. Enabled audit policies in Local Security Policy.
2. Opened Event Viewer and filtered for:
   - Event ID 4624 (Successful login)
   - Event ID 4625 (Failed login)
   - Event ID 4663 (File access)
3. Simulated failed login attempts to generate Event ID 4625 logs.
4. Observed timestamps to understand the sequence of login events.
